# Session 1 \| Introduction to the course + What is social justice?

# Session 2 \| Distributive justice

In this session, we will discuss the most relevant concepts and theories related to distributive justice. We will also explore their applications to education and the different conceptualisations of the *distribuendum* in education. Moreover, we will briefly examine the capabilities theory of justice as an alternative to Rawlsian approaches. Finally, we will explore the implications of distributive justice theories in conceptualising educational equity.

# Session 3 \| Recognition and representation

In this session, two other social justice dimensions will be discussed: recognition and representation. Also, we will examine how pluralist models of social justice can contribute to the analysis of educational phenomena and policies. Finally, we will analyse the potential dilemmas and trade-offs between distribution, recognition, and representation.

# Session 4 \| Towards a socially just school: the role of curriculum, pedagogy and teachers' beliefs

In this session we will reflect on the role of schools as sites for social justice and social transformation or, on the contrary, sites for social reproduction. We will particularly focus on curriculum, pedagogy and teachers’ beliefs as the main dimensions for analysing and building socially just schools for all.

# Session 6 \| Researching social justice in education
